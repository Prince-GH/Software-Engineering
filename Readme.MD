- Software Design
  - Introduction
    - Mechanism to convert user requirements into sutable forms which helps the progrmmer in software coding and implementaion.
    - SRS documentaion into simple form (`design`).
    - Representing the clint's requirement. 
    - In `SDLC` phase Design is the first steps to move the consentration from problem domain to solution domain.
    - Elements of a System
      - **Architecture** : Flowchart
      - **Modules** : Focus on specific task like in sign up page username section is a kind of module that only takes the name of user. Password section takes the password. 
      - **Component** : Perform a perticular functionality like sign up page store the data of user in database. login page porvide permission to authorized user.
      - **Interface** : Connection of diffrent components and make a interface. eg: connection of components like signup page, login page, Home page, Product page, and Contact page makes the interface of a website.
      - **Data** : To manage the information of the system.
    - Levels of Software Design
      - **Interface Design :** UI/UX Design, Ignored Working of internal system like flow of data.
      - **Architecture Design :** Focused on flow of data from module to module and component to component. 
      - **Detailed Design :** Focused on flow of the data how modules intract with other modules and components eg: modules of login page provide data to the server that gives permission to access the home page components. 

  - Objective
    - **Correctness :** Correctly implemented.
    - **Understandability :** Easy to understand and implement.
    - **Efficiency :** consider-Resource,time & cost.
    - **Maintainability :** Easy to update & modify.
  - Principles
    - **Should not suffer from "Tunnel Vision" :** Not only focus on completing the process but also focus on other effects.
    - **Tracable to analysis model :** Easy to trace all the steps and follow all the software requirements to devlop high quality products.
    - **Should not "Reinvent the wheel" :** Don't create a thing that is already exist. It will increase the overall development.
    - **Accommodate Change :** Software should adjust there self according the user requirment.
    - **Quality :** During the evaluation of the design, the quality of the design needs to be checked and focused upon.
    - **Review to discover error :** During the evaluation of the design, check the comming error and improve it.
    - **Design is not coding and coding is not design :** Design means to implement the logical way to sovle the problem and coding means to use the programming language to solve the logic.
  - Concepts
    - **Abstraction :** Hidding the complex logic from user.
    - **Modularity :** To implement the complex component, partition the component into smaller modules each dealing with a single task.
    - **Architecture :** It acts as a software development blueprint and a flowchart.
    - **Refinement :** Refinement is removing impurities and improving the quality of something. It deals with identifying and correcting possible errors.
    - **Information and data hiding :** give permission to access the different module. eg: Permission like private(Restricated from outside class) and public(have access of any outside calss).
- Methodologies
  - Introduction
    - Understand the problem
    - Focused on User requirment
    - Defining overall system design
  - Data Design
    - how data will be stored, accessed, manipulated, and secured to meet the requirements of the software application.
    - **Data Modeling :** Conceptual representation of data entity, attributes, relationship within a system. eg: ERD (Entity relationship diagram).Â 
    - **Database design :** Converting conceptual representation of data itno a physical database. eg: tables,columns,data type etc.
    - **Data security and access :** To provide the access to the data accroding to the importance and also use retional database like NoSql.
  - Architectural Design
    - Over all stractural of a system deals with components, intrface and communication between the modules and components. Mainly focused on modularity,scalablity and maintainability.
    - **Component Identification :** Deal with componet and there functionality.
    - **Interface Design :** Deal with communication between components.
  - Procedural Design
    - Focused area system functionality and effciently.
    - **Algorithm Design :** Design specific algorithm for specific task.
    - **Coding :** Implement by programming language.
  - Object Oriented Concepts
    - Key aspact are modularity, code reuseablity and maintainability.
    - **Class :** Perform specific task.
    - **Object :** Define functionaliy of an component using diffrent classes.
    - **Inheritance :** Allow sub calsses to use the specification of parent class.
    - **Polymorphism :** Using same code for diffrent uses also.
- Testing
