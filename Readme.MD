- Software Design
  - Introduction
    - Mechanism to convert user requirements into sutable forms which helps the progrmmer in software coding and implementaion.
    - SRS documentaion into simple form (`design`).
    - Representing the clint's requirement. 
    - In `SDLC` phase Design is the first steps to move the consentration from problem domain to solution domain.
    - Elements of a System
      - **Architecture** : Flowchart
      - **Modules** : Focus on specific task like in sign up page username section is a kind of module that only takes the name of user. Password section takes the password. 
      - **Component** : Perform a perticular functionality like sign up page store the data of user in database. login page porvide permission to authorized user.
      - **Interface** : Connection of diffrent components and make a interface. eg: connection of components like signup page, login page, Home page, Product page, and Contact page makes the interface of a website.
